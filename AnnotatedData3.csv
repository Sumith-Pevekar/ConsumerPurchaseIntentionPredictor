undefined,@ Apple  @AppleSupport  I'm aware that you're near a “Trillion” dollar company. So there's no  need  to make  iPhone  7s stop working with new updates because you want people to  buy  your new product! 
yes,I fell in  love   w  the  iPhone   X

no,The length of contract for this  IPhone   X  is 2 years as per usual ok. You pay £82 per month with EE ok. Crazy eh? I would not pay that in a million years are they having a laugh or what? I would recommend you  buy  a one plus 5 for £395 ok? Sim only  deal  for £20 per month with 3
no,We all want 3D face login?Edge to Edge display?Or is this just the people who want an  iPhone   X ? The only reason I won't  buy  this is because of the OLED burnin.  That won't  get  much better without using other OLED displays which they haven't done yet. Too many money for me  w / that
no,Also with that money I'd rather  buy  something  like  an iPad Pro than a  iPhone    X
no,"Grayson just randomly told me ""bro for $950 you can  buy  a llama"

undefined,On the  iPhone   X  I  wish  Apple adds an option of unlocking the  iphone  without that swipe up gesture. I feel that swipe up you  need  to do as of now is slowing down the unlocking process.
